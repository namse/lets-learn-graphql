# When is it good time to use Graphql?

- need to fetch multiple data at once
- need to fetch specific field of data only

# Why not Rest Api or Grpc?

- Because Graphql provides...
  - reduce payload size
    - field seleciton
  - easy to making code
    - multiple resources at once
    - simple endpoint
  - easy communication b/w front-end developers and back-end developers.

- But it's not a big deal that...
  - multiple http reqeust => can be solved by http/2 or websocket.


Graphql is not silver bullet. It's just Query Language.
